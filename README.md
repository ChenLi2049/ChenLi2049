### Hi there 😺

My name is Chen Li (李琛). I'm conducting research on neutrinos, the [fantastic](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02074-5) particles originating from ultra-high-energy cosmic sources. More specifically, I am working on developing Machine Learning models that reconstruct neutrino events for further analysis.

Please don't hesitate to contact me: [ChenLi2049@outlook.com](mailto:ChenLi2049@outlook.com)
