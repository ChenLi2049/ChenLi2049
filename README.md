### Hi there 😺

My name is Chen Li (李琛), and I'm interested in Physics, Programming, and Films. I'm conducting research on neutrinos, the ghost particles originating from ultra-high-energy cosmic sources. More specifically, I am working on developing Machine Learning models that reconstruct neutrino events for further analysis.

Please don't hesitate to contact me: [ChenLi2049@outlook.com](mailto:ChenLi2049@outlook.com)
